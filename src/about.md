# About Me
A math PhD. Music nerd. Love astronomy and interested in global climate system.

I'm currently working on solving partial differential equations using machining learning.

I used to maintain a WordPress website [bindow.top](https://bindow.top), and it's unproductive and heavy. So here we are using 11ty.
